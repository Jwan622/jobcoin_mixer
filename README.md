#### TransactionHandler

Let's say we have these transactions.

# insert global transactions

The `TransactionHandler` will filter transactions that were sent to mixed addresses generated by our `JobcoinMixer`.

```ruby
TransactionHandler.new(transaction_history, HouseDistributer::IDENTIFIER).process
```

In the above code, the `TransactionHandler` polls the Jobcoin history for transactions that sent to addresses created by the Mixer. These addresses can then be used to send money from the mixed address to the House Account.

```ruby
{"toAddress"=>"52c7ec313568730cbadff4cb7b59dd5696d9917393f07ba92d74a6b3d1cc93a4057dd6ab03ddde6d938180ff", "amount"=>10.0, "fromAddress"=>["1444"]}]
[{"toAddress"=>"0297bc772c4f6854b5eae2ce674fcf46f23d3574f1f13989919faaaf11c873", "amount"=>50.256899999999995, "fromAddress"=>["1444", "alice", "Alice"]},
 {"toAddress"=>"52cfe12035675455afcdc4dd6852dd4499463ce04f1c37bb17c645b26b4b4116", "amount"=>2.11, "fromAddress"=>["1444"]},
 {"toAddress"=>"52c7ec313568730cbadff4cb7b59dd5696d9917393f07ba92d74a6b3d1cc93a4057dd6ab03ddde6d938180ff", "amount"=>10.0, "fromAddress"=>["1444"]}]
```

Only the above addresses will be returned.


__NOTE__: Composition helps here to make this TransactionHandler more reusable. Provide it a set of transactions and an identifer and the handler will return only transactions with a `toAddress` encrypted by the identifier.


####Distributer logic

Issues:
1. How to make the methods idempotent. If one fails, I should be able to safely rerun the methods without running the risk of duplicate transfers.


- The house account has all the aggregated jobcoins. The issue here is determining which accounts to transfer jobcoins to while also avoiding duplicate
transfers.


#### Image Choice
- Xhibit meme was the clearest choice I had all project.
